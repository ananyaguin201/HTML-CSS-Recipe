    <h2>How to make Multi-Grain Pancakes</h2>

    <h4><U>STEP 1: Prepare the batter</U></h4>
    <p>Take two large bowls and in one of them combine all the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and oats with salt, baking powder
        and baking soda. Beat up the eggs in the other bowl and add milk, honey and yoghurt to it. Whisk well. 
        Now, add water to this bowl and mix well. Mix the contents of both the bowls together and finally add powdered cinnamon to it.</p>
         
        <h4><U>STEP 2: Cook and serve</U></h4>
        <p>Place a large non-stick pan over medium flame and pour some oil on it. Once the oil is hot enough, pour the batter prepared above on
             it in the spiral pattern. Cook till the batter turns slightly brown from all the sides and press it gently using a spatula. 
             Flip the sides so that it cooks well from all the sides. Make more pancakes with the leftover batter. 
            Your multi-grain pancakes are now ready to be served.</p>
